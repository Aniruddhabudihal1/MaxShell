# MaxShell — A Formula One Inspired Unix Shell

Welcome to **MaxShell**, a custom Unix shell inspired by the precision and dominance of F1 driver **Max Verstappen**. This shell project is a personal implementation of basic shell functionalities, built in C, mimicking real-world shell behavior with a fun F1 twist.

---

## Features

- Basic command prompt loop
- Built-in commands:
  - `ls` – lists files and directories
  - `cd <dir>` – change directory
  - `echo <args>` – print arguments to the shell
  - `clear` – clears the terminal
  - `exit` / `quit` – exits the shell with flair
- Output redirection using `>`
  - Example: `ls > out.txt`
- Support for **batch mode** (planned)
- Custom messages and error handling

---

## Usage

### Running the Shell (Interactive Mode)

```bash
$ ./maxshell
````

You’ll enter the **MaxShell prompt**, which looks like:

```
MaxShell>
```

### Batch Mode (Coming Soon)

```bash
$ ./maxshell batch
```

> Currently prints a placeholder. Batch file execution is a work in progress.

## Built-in Commands

| Command          | Description                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `ls`             | List directory contents            |
| `cd <dir>`       | Change to specified directory      |
| `echo <args>`    | Print arguments                    |
| `clear`          | Clear the terminal screen          |
| `exit` / `quit`  | Exit the shell                     |
| `cmd > file.txt` | Redirect output of `cmd` to a file |

---

## Error Handling

MaxShell handles basic errors and provides helpful messages such as:

* Directory not found
* File descriptor issues
* Command not recognized

---

## File Structure

```
.
├── maxshell.c     # Main shell source
├── header.h       # Declarations for shell functions
```

---

## Compilation

Compile the shell using:

```bash
gcc maxshell.c -o maxshell
```

> You can optionally use `-Wall -Werror` flags for strict compilation.

---

## Project Notes

This shell is themed around **Max Verstappen** — because just like Max, this shell doesn’t ask for permission. It executes with confidence and style.

> “Simply lovely!” – MaxShell when you quit.

---

## Roadmap

* [x] `ls`, `cd`, `echo`, `clear`, `exit`
* [x] Output redirection (`>`)
* [ ] Batch mode file execution
* [ ] Piping support (`|`)
* [ ] Custom shell variables
* [ ] Background processes (`&`)
